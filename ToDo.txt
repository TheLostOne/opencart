MY todo list;

 *) keep an eye on decent patches to main version
 *) Trawl forums looking for all posts where captain wonder-muppet insults people 
    - and include their code (as it's bound to be good (he only gets upset when someones posts proves how shite his code is))
 *) Check the Russian and Chinese forums (there are some good fixes there), as well as SO.
 1) Revise all DB calls, and start caching them (need to check (2) to do it right!)
 2) Revise the Date+Time - what moron set it to Y/M/D-T rather than a timestamp?
 3) Remove any crud DB-Table Indexes and apply proper ones (you know, the ones that have been around over a year and moron-master still hasn't included)
 4) Patch the security holes I saw, and include the anti-XSFR class
 5) Double check the sanitisation (chances are captin muppet has ballsed that up as well!)
 6) Anti XSS inclusion (use the default file and customise as needed)
 7) Patch in the custom product/catalog/info page inputs for SEO (Title, link title attrib, CLE override etc.)
 8) Rewrite SEO_URL (it stinks at the moment!)
 9) Rewrite Cat entries (inc. full pathing)
10) Index on/off (like Magento) - easy enough and should speed up input and  then speed up output
11) Cache system needs revising AND deployment on DB heavy/Low Change sections (cats/products)
12) Anti-mod system please - monitor entry files and if changed, throw
13) Speed optimisitions 
    (Catch, Combine, Compact, Compress, Cache for CSS/JS (PD, need to figure the Catch, remaining CCCC done!))
    (mod render to juggle call location(DONE)) 
    (mod render to apply missing H/W to IMG(DONE))
    (CDN and fallbacks(DONE))
    + Query/OutPut Caching (see (11))
14) Canonical System (part done, Pager methods should be applied to Filter/Sort/NumItems etc.)
15) Accessibility - change to semantic structure (why crappy tables???), apply <label>, place responses after with jump code etc.
    and Remove the stupid Alt+Title attributes, Title for Links, Alt for Images (morons!)
