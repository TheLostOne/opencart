List of changes/updates/fixes/patches etc. 
(All likely desparetly needed but not included due to Daniel Kerrs issues.)


1) Sort/Filter code (frontend)
\catalog\view\theme\default\template\product\category.php
Original code used same var for in and out,
New code uses different var for out (so now you can duplicate the filters without stupid errors).


2) Pagination fix
\system\library\pagination.php
Made all links to [page1] canonical - no more "page=1" in the URL
(includes [FirstPage] [Previous] and [1])

 
Category fixes (frontend)
\catalog\model\catalog\category.php
\catalog\controller\module\category.php
\catalog\view\theme\default\template\module\category.tpl
New DB Calls in {model} for getAllCategories & getAllProducts
New recursive functions in {controller} to generate category tree with no-stubs and product counts
New output code in {template} to output nested categories
