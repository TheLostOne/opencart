# OpenCart


## Overview

This is my fork of the popular OpenCart ecommerce platform.
Unfortunately, despite it's popularity, OC is bug ridden, insecure, slow and performs very poorly due to shoddy code structre.
As the owner of OC seems incapable of acknowledging any fault with his code/platform (some bugs have existed for a very long time!), I've decided to fork it and fix it.

If you are Serious about your ecommerce endevours, please do Not use the default OpenCart.
Instead, consider either this (the patched version) or a different platform.


## Reporting a bug
	
Please read the instructions below before you create a bug report.
 
 1. Don't bother posting a bug in the main OC repository - Daniel Kerr will simply close it after throwing a childish tantrum (just look at [GitHub bug tracker](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/issues) for examples!).
 2. Please make sure you have searched via a search engine and looked in forums etc.
 3. Look through "here" ([GitHub bug tracker](https://github.com/TheLostOne/opencart/issues)) to see what you can find.
 4. If your bug is related to the OpenCart core code then please create a bug report on GitHub so Daniel Kerr can have a little eppy-fit, call you a few names and generally behave like a moron ... and if your code is good, include it anyway without apologising...

**Important!**
- If your bug report is not related to the core code (such as a 3rd party module or your server configuration) then the issue will be closed without a reason. You must use the forum or a commercial partner to resolve a 3rd party code issue.
- If you would like to report a serious security bug please PM an OpenCart moderator on the forum


## How to Contribute

Fork the repository, edit and submit a pull request.

Please be very clear on your commit messages and pull request, empty pull request messages may be rejected without reason.

Your code should be inline with the [OpenCart coding standards](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/wiki/Coding-standards).

Be willing to accept stupid retorts, insults and false claims from Daniel Kerr whilst his tiny little brain tries really hard to keep up with you and try to understand what your "good code" does that his code (read as "shite code") doesn't.
