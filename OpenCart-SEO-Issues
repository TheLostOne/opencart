#SEO Issues in OpenCart

The following have been pointed out to the OC owner, Daniel Kerr,
who has denied their existence and deleted the comments :(

##1) Title Tags
As we all know, one of the most influential On-Page factors is the Title Element.
Yet there is No custom field/input for the <title> tag in OpenCart.
It instead uses the "name" field for products/categories.

##2) Heading Text
Another On-Page factor are the headings (<h1>, <h2> etc.).
Again, there is little/no control over this for categories/products, and again,
you are forced to use the "name" input for that value.

##3) Link Text
Links are important - link text holds a fair amount of influence.
Yet DK has decided that you shouldn't be able to control that either (again, "name" is used instead).

##4) Link Title Attribute
Though I'm yet to see Google/Bing confirm it's usage, it is of use to some users.
But there is no input method for this either.

##5) Canonical Link Element
At present, only Products carry the CLE.
There is no CLE system for Categories or Info pages (which considering the below is a problem,
as OpenCart is rife with Canonical Issues and the resulting Internal Duplication!)
a)The Pager/Pagination system creates dupes due to "/" and "/page=1"
b)The Sort system generates dupes due to "default"
c)The view-items generates dupes due to "default"
d)Homepage comes with 3 possible URLs, "/", "/index.php", "/index.php?route=common/home"
etc.
This is worsened due to the SEO_URL system, and how badly the Cateogories system works.
Basically, it uses the "last" "valid" value in the URL to fetch content for.
That means people can link to mostly false URLs, still get a 200 response.
(If you have a category path of "/cat1/cat2/" - you can access it via "/cat2", "/fake/cat2", "/cat1/cat2/fake" etc.)
(DK refused to acknowledge this massive flaw, and deleted the comments!)

##6) Canonical / 301s
There is currently no system/method in OC to handle redirects or overriding canonical link elements.
This means changing categories/products will cause SE Ranking problems.

##7) Robot Meta
There is currently NO Robots system in place.  This means you have no way of applying "noindex" to any pages,
including Search results (and the SE's have clearly stated that we should not allow indexing of internal search results).

##8) LoadTimes
Unfortunately - this falls into 2 core groups.
a) The first is PRocessing Time ... due to some seriously poor DB Calls and php, 
Category menu generation is incredibly slow (has been for years!).
There is also a seriously lack of Query/Generated caches (which would at least patch the problem)
The standard install (with only a few categories/products) will typically take 2.6+ seconds.  
If you get serious with the number of Categories/Products, you may look at process times of 10+ seconds !!!
Again, though flagged, Daniel Kerr is ignored the issue.
b) The second side is basic design best practices have been ignored (comments explaining better methods were deleted).
So rather than using CDNs (google etc.) for things like JQuery, the tempalte forces you to use a local version.
Javascript is slotted into the <body> willy nilly, rather than being consolidated and located at the bottom of </body>,
(as is advised as best practice for years!).
The is no "combine" method - resulting in numerous JS and CSS files being loaded, causing page load speeds to take even longer.
Both of those together may cause abandonment issues, and loss of revenue (that's if people can find your site!).

## On the upside ...

I can fix all of those.
So you don't have to put up with seriously shoddy SEO handicapping due to crappy code!
